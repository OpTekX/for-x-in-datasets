During the Fall semester of 2005, two students in our program--Rachel Mullet and
Lauren Garafola--did a senior research project in which they studied a
phenomenon called Inattentional Blindness (IB). IB refers to situations in which
a person fails to see an obvious stimulus right in front of his eyes. (For
details see this website.) In their study, Rachel and Lauren had subjects view
an online video showing college students passing basketballs to each other, and
the task was to count the number of times students in white shirts passed the
basketball. During the video, a person in a black gorilla suit walked though the
picture in a very obvious way. At the end of the video, subjects were asked if
they saw the gorilla. Most did not!

Rachel and Lauren hypothesized that IB could be predicted from performance on
the Stroop Color Word test. This test produces three scores: "W" (word alone,
i.e., a score derived from reading a list of color words such as red, green,
black), "C" (color alone, in which a score is derived from naming the color in
which a series of Xs are printed), and "CW" (the Stroop task, in which a score
is derived from the subject's attempt to name the color in which a color word is
printed when the word and the color do not agree). The data are in the following
table, in which the response, "seen", is coded as 0=no and 1=yes.
